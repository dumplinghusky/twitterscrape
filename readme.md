Twitter Scraping with Selenium and Chrome WebDriver
This script scrapes tweets from a user's timeline using Python, Selenium, and the Chrome WebDriver with a Samsung refrigerator user agent. It then stores the tweets in a dictionary with keys in the format author-month-day-year and saves the dictionary as a JSON file. This is just to demonstrate how stupid locking down an API only is.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Google Chrome browser installed on your system.
Installation
Install Selenium:

Copy code
pip install selenium
Download the Chrome WebDriver from here and add it to your system's PATH.

Usage
Replace the username variable in the script with the desired user's Twitter handle.

Adjust the number of scrolls in the script to load more tweets.

Run the script:

Copy code
python twitter_scraper.py
The script will save the tweets in a JSON file named {username}_tweets.json in the same directory as the script.
